# Try first when you face an issue

## Issue like "The behaviour is different from Vim"
Check the behaviour in https://codemirror.net/demo/vim.html first.
If the issue can be reproduced in CodeMirror as well, the issue is in CodeMirror and could not be fixed in this plugin.

## Issue like "A mapping is missed"

Check the source code to see if it is missed or mapped to other keys.
